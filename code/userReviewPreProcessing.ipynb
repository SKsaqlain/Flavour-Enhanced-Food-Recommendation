The brie pretty much disappeared while baking, if I do it again I would add some brie to the top of each breast towards the end of cooking. The dish was best when you could get a perfect bite of chicken, bacon, and apricot all together (if the brie had held together that bite would have been out of this world!). Choose really fat chicken breasts so you can really stuff it with the brie and bacon. Ease of on the apricot, it’s quite sweet. Maybe combine the apricot and balsamic over heat and use as a sauce. That would be tasty.'},\n",

I also added 1 potato, peeled and sliced thin, as well as 1 carrot peeled and thinly sliced. I sautéed those with the broccoli and garlic and ginger, while sautéing I also sprinkled some extra curry powder on top. Recipe still didn't come out quite spicy enough for my liking so I added extra curry paste to my plate at the end, worked out well cause it was mild enough for my son to eat it as it was!

My changes are (one is intentional and the other is not):\\nI substituted regular sugar with brown (same amount) as I didn’t want it to be very sweet, and had to use bleached flour since I mistakenly bought it instead of unbleached kind. Also I baked it 10 min more as after 55 min as directed by the recipe it seemed to be still very moist and my wooden stick didn’t come out clean. I don’t think my changes affected too much of the quality and taste of this bread - it is absolutely delicious not very sweet came out of pan super easy smells great and looks very appetizing. Definitely will make it again.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'Just made it with few changes and it turned out perfect and delicious! I’m eating it right now as I’m writing this review lol. My changes are (one is intentional and the other is not):\\nI substituted regular sugar with brown (same amount) as I didn’t want it to be very sweet, and had to use bleached flour since I mistakenly bought it instead of unbleached kind. Also I baked it 10 min more as after 55 min as directed by the recipe it seemed to be still very moist and my wooden stick didn’t come out clean. I don’t think my changes affected too much of the quality and taste of this bread - it is absolutely delicious not very sweet came out of pan super easy smells great and looks very appetizing. Definitely will make it again.'},\n",
