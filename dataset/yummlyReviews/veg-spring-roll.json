I've made these a number of times especially when everyone else around me is eating samosas and all things fried. I've never had a problem with them browning. I just ensure I don't soak the rice papers for too long, I line my baking tray with baking paper and cook at the recommended temperature & turn them once the first side is brown. Thanks \ud83d\ude0d"
