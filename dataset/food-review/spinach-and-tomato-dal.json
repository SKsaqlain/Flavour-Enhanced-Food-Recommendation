[["spinach and tomato dal", 29628889, "Earnest kitchen tip: always keep a bag of frozen, chopped spinach or kale on hand. Add it to dal, soup, beans, tomato pasta sauce /whatever at a late stage, cook long enough to make it tender (won't take long). Will add color, flavor; and sneak in an extra vegetable."]]
